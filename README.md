TOP - Library Javascript Project (Objects &amp; Constructors)

This project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library?ref=lnav]

The goal of this project is to get practice using javascript objects, constructors and grasp an understanding of prototyping.

I also added a database using Firebase so that users books get saved in the database.

The final project can be viewed here [https://rueeazy.github.io/js-library/].
